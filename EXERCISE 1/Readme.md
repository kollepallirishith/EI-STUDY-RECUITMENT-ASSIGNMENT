# Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide a template for how to solve problems in various situations. Design patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.

## 1. Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns abstract the instantiation process and make it more flexible. Examples include:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of created objects.


## 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with object composition, helping to ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change. These patterns allow you to create relationships between objects in a flexible way. Examples include:

- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into another that a client expects.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.


## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on communication between objects, defining how objects interact in a manner that is flexible and efficient. These patterns emphasize the responsibilities of objects and how they collaborate. Examples include:

- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.


## Conclusion

Understanding these design patterns can significantly enhance your ability to write maintainable and reusable code. They provide time-tested solutions that can help solve complex design challenges in your software development projects.
