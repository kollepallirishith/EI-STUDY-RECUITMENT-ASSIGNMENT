# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects, focusing on how they can work together to form larger structures while keeping flexibility and efficiency. This README covers two commonly used structural design patterns: **Adapter** and **Facade** patterns.

## 1. Adapter Pattern

### Overview

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible types by converting the interface of one class into an interface that the client expects. This pattern enables the reuse of existing classes, even if they do not match the required interface.

### Use Case

- **Temperature Converter**: In a temperature conversion application, the Adapter Pattern can be used to adapt a temperature measurement system that provides temperature in Celsius to an application that requires temperature in Fahrenheit. The adapter would convert the input from Celsius to Fahrenheit, allowing the application to function seamlessly without modifying the existing temperature measurement class.

## 2. Facade Pattern

### Overview

The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and provides an easier interface for clients to interact with. This pattern helps reduce dependencies on the subsystem, making the code easier to maintain and understand.

### Use Case

- **Home Theater Facade**: In a home theater system, multiple components (like a DVD player, projector, sound system, etc.) can be complicated to manage individually. The Facade Pattern can provide a single interface to control these components. For example, a `HomeTheaterFacade` class can have methods like `watchMovie()` and `endMovie()`, which internally manage the operations required to turn on the projector, adjust the sound system, and start the DVD player, thereby simplifying user interaction with the entire system.

## Conclusion

The Adapter and Facade patterns are crucial in creating well-structured, maintainable code. The Adapter Pattern facilitates interoperability between incompatible interfaces, allowing for easier integration of new functionalities. The Facade Pattern simplifies complex systems by providing a unified interface, enhancing usability and reducing dependencies. Understanding and utilizing these patterns can greatly improve the design of software applications.
